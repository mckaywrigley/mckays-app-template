## Architecture

This is a Next.js 15 SaaS template using the App Router with clear separation between authenticated and unauthenticated routes.

### Route Structure
- `/app/(unauthenticated)` - Public routes
  - `(marketing)` - Landing pages, pricing, features
  - `(auth)` - Login and signup flows
- `/app/(authenticated)` - Protected routes requiring Clerk auth
  - `dashboard` - Main application with account and support sections
- `/app/api` - API routes for various backend functionality

### Key Patterns
- **Server Actions** in `/actions` for data mutations (customers)
- **Database Schema** in `/db/schema` using Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- **UI Components** in `/components/ui` from Shadcn UI library
- **Authentication** handled by Clerk middleware with protected route groups

### Data Flow
1. Authentication state managed by Clerk (`@clerk/nextjs`)
2. Customer data stored in PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM
3. Server actions handle all data mutations with proper auth checks

### Environment Variables Required
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - Clerk public key
- `CLERK_SECRET_KEY` - Clerk secret key
- Database connection handled by Supabase CLI
